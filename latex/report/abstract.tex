Software is everywhere, in every walk of our life with new advancements such as ‘Internet of Things’. Recently, the reports show that there has been a trillion-dollar loss because of the presence of bugs in software. Static analysis plays a significant role in software development to find bugs and any vulnerabilities in code. There are different static analysis tools available in the market. However, various surveys found about why the static analysis tools are not as efficient as expected by software developers. The problems found out to be such as bad warning messages, complex user interface. Although there are solutions in industries to workaround while using a single tool, it results in new issues when using multiple tools. Recent research, it is found that in a typical software development organisation, they use multiple tools, including legacy tools used in nightly builds as an example.
On the other hand, with on-going research trends in using multiple static analysis tools, such as Tricorder, Parfait shows the opportunity and importance of developing a single interface for multiple tools. This thesis aims to address the scenario where a developer works with different tools and how adaptive it could be the user interface. The novel ideas, including approaches adapted from different software engineering disciplines, are evaluated through the user experience design cycle. Designs made with assimilated ideas, and prototypes are built using a wireframe tool. Evaluation phase considers the usability aspect of the proposed ideas. The target users for this evaluation are software developers who has good experience in programming, which ensures the applicability of this thesis work. Thereby, the evaluated solution ideas acts as a forward step to the development of the interface. \\ \\
