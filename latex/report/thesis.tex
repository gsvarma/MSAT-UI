Namaste. I want to express my deepest gratitude to the eternal divine power, which governs and safeguards the universe. My heartful thanks to my thesis mentor, Ms Lisa Nguyen Quang Do for the best support and guidance through the challenges that came up while fulfilling my thesis term. \\ \\

My special thanks to the user study participants who helped in gathering quality data — also, Mr Stefan Krüger and Mr Marcus Nachtigall for valuable feedbacks provided during the research. I appreciate my thesis supervisor, Dr.-Ing. Ben Hermann for the opportunity to do the thesis in his department. \\ \\

Last but not the least, thank you for everyone who blessed me with their words and prayers. May God bless you all. Om Shanti. \\ \\ \\ \\

\noindent P.S. These are the most straightforward words I could write in a page for my everlasting gratitude to all the guidance I received through my thesis research journey and to the ones who touched me spiritually.
