\label{ch:objectives_report}

Static analysis tools suffer from well-documented usability issues. \cite{CB16,JSMB13} In the current research, we find that a typical software organisation uses multiple static analysis tools. This kind of usage leads to the issue where the user interface has to be adaptive in integrating such different tools. \\ \\ \\


In this thesis, different user interface designs allow code developers to navigate around this issue in a non-disruptive way. \\ \\ \\

\begin{enumerate}
	
\item  Research different techniques, as mentioned in \autoref{ch:approaches_report} that tackle the particular research question in other domains of software engineering.

\item  Adapt those techniques and design prototypes with own techniques for the domain of static analysis.

\item  Design prototypes with a Balsamiq wireframe tool \cite{B} of those techniques to improve the usability of integrating analysis tools.

\item  Design user studies that test the efficiency of those techniques with professional code developers.

\item  Run the user studies and report on their results.

\item  Loop 2 $\rightarrow$ 5 until towards we achieve a good user experience.
\end{enumerate}
