The effectiveness of Software Development relies on bug free coding. In our day to day progress in coding leads to complexity of software which brings a broader scope for bugs and vulnerabilities that could be introduced easily. There are many Static Analysis tools available in market to address these primary issues. However in latest surveys by Maria \etal{} \cite{CB16} and by Johnson \etal{} \cite{JSMB13} it is noticed that Software Developers are not quite happy with effectiveness and usability of Static Analysis tools. This brings the scope for improvement of Static Analysis tools and the paper by Nguyen Quang Do \etal{} \cite{NB18} introduces how Gamifying the bug fixing process could enhance the usability of Static Analysis tool.
