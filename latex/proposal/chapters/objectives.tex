Static analysis tools suffer from well-documented usability issues \cite{CB16,JSMB13}. Some analysis tools can report results in milliseconds, while others can take up to hours or
days. This discrepancy in waiting times can be confusing to code developers, and in some poorly implemented
tools, can lead to them thinking that the tooling froze when it is simply computing results. \\ \\
In this thesis, it is researched on different user interface designs that allow code developers to navigate around
this issue in a non-disruptive way. \\ \\
1. Research different techniques that tackle the issue of responsiveness in other domains of software
engineering. \\ \\
2. Adapt those techniques and design own techniques for the domain of static analysis. \\ \\
3. Design prototypes with a mocking tool \cite{B} of those techniques to improve the usability of analysis tools -
with respect to responsiveness- (e.g., FindBugs, Soot, Checkmarx, etc.). \\ \\
4. Design user studies that evaluate the efficiency of those techniques, with professional code developers. \\ \\
5. Run the user studies and report on their results.
