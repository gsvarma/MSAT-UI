Static analysis tools suffer from well-documented usability issues \cite{CB16,JSMB13}. In the current research, it is found out that a typical software organisation uses multiple tools. This leads to the issue where the user interface has to be adaptive in integrating such different tools. \\ \\ \\
In this thesis, it is researched on different user interface designs that allow code developers to navigate around
this issue in a non-disruptive way. \\ \\ \\
1. Research different techniques that tackle the similar issue in other domains of software
engineering. \\ \\
2. Adapt those techniques and design own techniques for the domain of static analysis. \\ \\
3. Design prototypes with a wireframe tool \cite{B} of those techniques to improve the usability of integrating analysis tools. \\ \\
4. Design user studies that evaluate the efficiency of those techniques, with professional code developers. \\ \\
5. Run the user studies and report on their results. \\ \\
6. Loop 2 $\rightarrow$ 5
